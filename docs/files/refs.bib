abstract = {The emergence of synchronization in a network of coupled oscillators is a fascinating topic in various scientific disciplines. A widely adopted model of a coupled oscillator network is characterized by a population of heterogeneous phase oscillators, a graph describing the interaction among them, and diffusive and sinusoidal coupling. It is known that a strongly coupled and sufficiently homogeneous network synchronizes, but the exact threshold from incoherence to synchrony is unknown. Here, we present a unique, concise, and closed-form condition for synchronization of the fully nonlinear, nonequilibrium, and dynamic network. Our synchronization condition can be stated elegantly in terms of the network topology and parameters or equivalently in terms of an intuitive, linear, and static auxiliary system. Our results significantly improve upon the existing conditions advocated thus far, they are provably exact for various interesting network topologies and parameters; they are statistically correct for almost all networks; and they can be applied equally to synchronization phenomena arising in physics and biology as well as in engineered oscillator networks, such as electrical power networks. We illustrate the validity, the accuracy, and the practical applicability of our results in complex network scenarios and in smart grid applications.},

Abstract = {Multiple types of fluctuations impact the collective dynamics of power grids and thus challenge their robust operation. Fluctuations result from processes as different as dynamically changing demands, energy trading and an increasing share of renewable power feed-in. Here we analyse principles underlying the dynamics and statistics of power grid frequency fluctuations. Considering frequency time series for a range of power grids, including grids in North America, Japan and Europe, we find a strong deviation from Gaussianity best described as L{\'e}vy-stable and q-Gaussian distributions. We present a coarse framework to analytically characterize the impact of arbitrary noise distributions, as well as a superstatistical approach that systematically interprets heavy tails and skewed distributions. We identify energy trading as a substantial contribution to today's frequency fluctuations and effective damping of the grid as a controlling factor enabling reduction of fluctuation risks, with enhanced effects for small power grids.},

	abstract = {Recent work reported in the literature suggests that for the long-term integration of Hamiltonian dynamical systems one should use methods that preserve the symplectic structure of the flow. In this paper the symplecticity of numerical integrators is investigated for constrained Hamiltonian systems with holonomic constraints. The following two results will be derived. (i) It is shown that any first- or second-order symplectic integrator for unconstrained problems can be generalized to constrained systems such that the resulting scheme is symplectic and preserves the constraints. Based on this, higher-order methods can be derived by the same composition methods used for unconstrained problems. (ii) Leimkuhler and Reich [Math. Comp, 63 (1994), pp. 589-605] derived symplectic integrators based on Dirac's reformulation of the constrained problem as an unconstrained Hamiltonian system. However, although the unconstrained reformulation can be handled by direct application of any symplectic implicit Runge-Kutta method, the resulting schemes do not preserve the constraints. In this paper it is shown that these schemes can be modified such that they also preserve the constraints.},
