\begin{abstract}
In this report, we introduce a chance constrained AC optimal power flow (CC-ACOPF) problem.
Uncertainty is introduced via exogenous active and reactive power perturbations which are assumed to (1) originate from solar generation/demand and (2) follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution.
This uncertainty is then propagated through the power flow equations to yield a distribution over (box) inequality constraints involving variables of a traditional ACOPF problem.
